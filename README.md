# swru

My stuff for hopefully helping out Switchroot / Linux4Switch communities

l4s-switchroot-update-script.bash

First attempt as super duper semi-automated update script for swru updates and apt updates.

Technically we shouldn't need to worry about apt updates but as we want to help w/ the release updates it is in there.

Hmm ... well before I really creep scope this puppy I'll hold off but maybe adding some switches / args may be good.
