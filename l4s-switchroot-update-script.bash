#Z# I'd like to know the following :
#Z# - dock works (and switch the right nvpmodel profile)
#Z# - joycon autopairing works
#Z# - audio works
#Z# - login screen works
#Z# - joycons in general
#Z# - hdmi auto change sound output
#Z# - jack switching audio works
#Z# - mic works 

# If there's any possible updates, do them. do-release-upgrade requires it
# anyway and CTCaer also wanted me to have my stuff in place. I may want
# to have a bit of a cron "state" in place to make it even more automated.
